# ðŸ¥” A Potato Theme for Gatsby

A blog theme for [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/). To see what it looks like, have a look at the [demo blog](https://demo-gatsby-theme-potato.netlify.com/) or my [personal blog](https://blog.castiel.me).

> **Warning!** I created this theme because I wanted to separate the content and the presentation of my personal blog. I tried to make it as clean as possible, but you shouldnâ€™t consider it reusable as is. Still, feel free to fork it, hack it, submit issues, PRs, or to use it as you want ðŸ˜‰

## Features

- Write your articles in [Markdown](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/guides/markdown/)
- Add a language and a category to each post
- Add a cover image to your posts
- Display the [reading time](https://github.com/syntra/gatsby-remark-reading-time)
- Add infos for [Twitter Cards](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/optimize-with-cards/overview/summary-card-with-large-image)
- Add a newsletter subscription form to sidebar or post footer
- Add static pages

## Usage

The easiest way to boostrap a new blog with this theme is to clone the demo blog, for instance by downloading [a ZIP of the repo](https://github.com/scastiel/gatsby-theme-potato/archive/master.zip).

- `/content` contains posts, pages and assets.
- `/src` contains components you want to customize (see section [Customization](#customization) below).

## Options

Options are set in the _gatsby-config.js_ file:

```js
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    {
      resolve: `gatsby-theme-potato`,
      options: {
        postsPrefix: 'posts'
      }
    },
// ...
```

Available options:

- `postsPrefix`: prefix for posts URL. If empty, the URL will be `/the-post-slug`; if you set it to `posts`, it will be `/posts/the-post-slug`

## Customization

Some parts of this theme were designed so you can customize them by [overriding source files](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/theme-api/#overriding):
