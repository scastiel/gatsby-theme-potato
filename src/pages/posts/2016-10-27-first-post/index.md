Today I'm starting a new blog. I started a few blogs in the past. Personal blogs, where I talked about a lot of things. This blog is very different, here's why:

- it's a developer blog. Yes, all articles will (probably) be technical articles, mostly talking about web developement (♥️ JavaScript), but also other related stuff.
- it's written in English. Maybe you have not realized that it's not my native language because my English is perfect, but I'm French. So writing for this blog is also an opportunity to practice my English writing skills ;)

Oh and by the way, there is no Wordpress here. The blog you are reading is fully statically generated, which means that somewhere on the Internet, the service hosting this blog contains all HTML files (and other resources). So no PHP, no Node.js, no Ruby… But in return, a very fast website.

And although you can find a few very good static blog generators ([Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) is probably the most famous one), I was very excited about developing my own, because I wanted something very minimalistic. So I created [Miblog](https://github.com/scastiel/miblog). It's fully free and open source of course, so feel free to use it, work on it, adapt it to your own needs, or maybe just tell me why you find it awesome/awful !

Thanks for reading this great article, now it's time for me to start writing real articles for this blog. See you soon!
